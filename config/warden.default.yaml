# Claude Warden - Default Configuration Reference
#
# Copy to ~/.claude/warden.yaml (user-level) or .claude/warden.yaml (project-level) to customize.
#
# Config priority: project > user > built-in defaults.
# Within each scope, alwaysDeny is checked before alwaysAllow, and the first
# scope with a matching rule wins (e.g. a project rule overrides a user rule
# for the same command).

# Default decision for commands not covered by any rule: allow | deny | ask
defaultDecision: ask

# If true, commands containing $() or backticks trigger "ask"
askOnSubshell: true

# Additional commands to always allow (checked after alwaysDeny within this scope)
# alwaysAllow:
#   - terraform
#   - flyctl
#   - my-safe-tool

# Additional commands to always deny (checked first within this scope)
# alwaysDeny:
#   - nc
#   - ncat

# Trusted SSH hosts — ssh/scp/rsync to these hosts are auto-allowed.
# Remote commands on trusted hosts are recursively evaluated through warden rules.
# Supports glob patterns (* wildcards).
# trustedSSHHosts:
#   - devserver
#   - staging-*
#   - "*.internal.company.com"
#   - 192.168.1.*

# Trusted Docker containers — docker exec to these containers are auto-allowed.
# Remote commands are recursively evaluated through warden rules.
# trustedDockerContainers:
#   - my-app
#   - dev-*

# Trusted kubectl contexts — kubectl exec in these contexts are auto-allowed.
# Remote commands (after --) are recursively evaluated through warden rules.
# trustedKubectlContexts:
#   - minikube
#   - dev-cluster-*

# Trusted Sprites — sprite exec/console to these sprites are auto-allowed.
# Remote commands are recursively evaluated through warden rules.
# trustedSprites:
#   - my-sprite
#   - dev-*

# Command-specific rules (override built-in rules by command name).
# The first scope (project > user > default) with a rule for a given command wins.
# rules:
#   - command: npx
#     default: allow          # Trust all npx in this project
#   - command: docker
#     default: ask
#     argPatterns:
#       - match:
#           anyArgMatches: ['^(ps|images|logs)$']
#         decision: allow
